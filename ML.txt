Artificial Intelligence:
    Algorithms or Methods enabled by 
    Constraints exposed by
    Representations that support
    Models targeted at 
    Thinking Perception and Action
    Connected through loops

Generate and Test approach:
    Generate solutions and test for results

Problem reduction tree | And Or tree | Goal tree: Tells us possible solutions in the form of a n-ary tree

Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Supervised Learning: 
    Input X and Labels Y -> Mapping X to Y
Unsupervised Learning:
    Input X with no labels -> Find patterns, figure out what groups belong together
Deep Learning: Neural Networks
Reinforcement Learning: Reward System
